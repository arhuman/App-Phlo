App/Plho version 0.01
=======================

Phlo stands for 'Perl hard link optimizer'.
This utility was made beccause one day, as I was lacking space on one
of my VM, I look at the directories using a lot of space, and my perlbrew
was one of them. 
That made think about all the duplicates files that were there 
(Same modules in all Perl versions, same licenses/generated files everywhere...)

As I had already made a short script to find and delete all the duplicates in
my multimedia files collection (ebooks, mp3, movies...) I decided to try to
hard link the duplicates instead.

I test it on my perl5/perlbrew directory:

$diff -r perl5.phlowed perl5.ori

showed no differences, but:

$du -sh perl5 perl5.ori
680M  perl5.ori
590M  perl5.phlowed

And most importantly the test suites of the modules I was working on still pass with
the differents Perl installed...

I tought at first that it would be a good patch for perlbrew if it worked.
But thinking about it, there is probably a need for a general tool of its own:
Everytime read-only data are duplicated on a same filesystem (hard link) this
technique can be used...

So here is my attempt to provide such a tool.
